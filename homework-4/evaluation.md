## 40 points for code which follows the guidelines.
1. Assignment operators (e.g., "operator=" functions) should be member functions, everything else should be a free function
   ```
   yes=+20/3
   ```
2. Do they have everything accounted for? They should have the following implemented using operators
     1. Vector and Matrix assignment (=) operators
     ```
     yes=+20/3
     ```
     2. Matrix-vector multiplication
     ```
     yes=+20/3
     ```
     3. Scalar-vector + vector-scalar multiplication
     ```
     yes=+20/3
     ```
     4. Scalar-matrix + matrix-scalar multiplication
     ```
     yes=+20/3
     ```
     5. Scalar-vector, vector-scalar, vector-vector, and matrix-matrix addition/subtraction/multiplication/division
     ```
     yes=+20/3
     ```

## 20 points for code building with "make"/specified on pdf.
```
yes=+20

## 5 points: miscellaneous (is it tagged, does it have the right directory structure)
```
yes=+5

There are some issues with free, but given that debug tools for memory are not part of the syllabus, I will not remove any point, see logout for summary of your implementation.
